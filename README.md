# Python Web Scraper

## Objective
1. Become more familiar with the Python language.
2. Scrape the [Pagat](https://www.pagat.com) database in order to create a card game dataset for feeding to a neural network.
3. Format data for easier machine reading.
4. Generate a CSV ("card_games.csv").

## Dependencies
* BeautifulSoup
* requests
* urllib.request
* time
* csv

## To do
- Collaborate with George on the neural network
- Train the neural network
- Produce a card game that remotely resembles something we can play. 
- Interpret the machine's output.
- Record ourselves playing the game.

(All of these coming soon, hopefully!)
