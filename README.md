# Computers suck at card games
### An AI attempts to create its own card games.

## Objective
1. Become more familiar with the Python language.
2. ~~Scrape the [Pagat](https://www.pagat.com) database in order to create a card game dataset for feeding to a neural network.~~
3. ~~Format data for easier machine reading.~~
4. ~~Generate text files from data.~~
5. Feed them to a machine learning algorithm and let hilarity ensue.

## Dependencies
* BeautifulSoup
* requests
* urllib.request
* time
* [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn)
* TensorFlow

## Run it!
1. Install dependencies (`pip3 install bs4 requests urllib3 tensorflow textgenrnn`)
2. `python3 ./scraper.py`
3. `python3 ./game-generator.py`


## To do
- Collaborate with George on the neural network
- Train the neural network
- Produce a card game that remotely resembles something we can play. 
- Interpret the machine's output.
- Record ourselves playing the game.

(All of these coming soon, hopefully!)
